What should I expect the data format to be?

The data is images of wheat fields, with bounding boxes for each identified wheat head. Not all images include wheat heads / bounding boxes. The images were recorded in many locations around the world.

The CSV data is simple - the image ID matches up with the filename of a given image, and the width and height of the image are included, along with a bounding box (see below). There is a row in train.csv for each bounding box. Not all images have bounding boxes.


Most of the test set images are hidden. A small subset of test images has been included for your use in writing code.

What am I predicting?

You are attempting to predict bounding boxes around each wheat head in images that have them. If there are no wheat heads, you must predict no bounding boxes.

# Files
train.csv - the training data

sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

train.zip - training images
test.zip - test images

Columns

image_id - the unique image ID
width, height - the width and height of the images
bbox - a bounding box, formatted as a Python-style list of [xmin, ymin, width, height]
etc.
